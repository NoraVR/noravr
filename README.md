# hi chat üê±

### who am i?
hi there! i'm nora, possibly the worst coder ive ever met, i'm very inconsistent and only really dev for fun  
i am very much a beginner, but i'm always interested in learning new things
### where can we chat?
i'm in a lot of different corners of the internet, but i do not actively accept friend requests in most places.  
however, if you're just *dying* to talk to me, feel free to shoot me an email at `norainbox` @ `proton.me`[^1]



[^1]: do remember however, it will likely take me AGES to respond
